NOTICE: the FCD and AirSpy receivers have been contributed by users of this
software. i have no way to test if they work. i support  only the hardware
that i have, so if you want support and can't do it yourself,  then please
donate whatever hardware you want to be supported (but first please try
yourself, this isn't rocket science, and the software was written to be
modular and flexible)
